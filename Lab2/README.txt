The included PNG file is a flow-chart outlining the control-flow of the included Java Program.


The file Assigment2.txt is a PlantUML source file, which can be compiled into a PNG file identical to the one that is included.

	PlantUML source code is essentially weaponized pseudocode that can be turned into a flowchart.
	
As such, I hope that either the included image, or the PlantUML source used to create it 
	is sufficient to
 fulfill my pseudocode/Flowchart requirement.
